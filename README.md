This project is about analyzing the performance of different stocks based on their price data.
The goal is to read stock information from a CSV file, calculate the return percentage for each stock, rank them based on performance, and find out which sector performed the best on average.
The project basically automates a small part of financial data analysis — where we calculate percentage returns, organize data by sectors, and export the processed results to a new CSV file for reporting or further use.
It covers essential programming skills like file handling, data cleaning, sorting, calculations, and report generation — all of which are useful in real-world data analysis and finance applications.
